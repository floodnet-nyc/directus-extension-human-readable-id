Directus Extension: dwaring87-interface-human-readable-id
====

A Directus v9 Interface for generating a human-readable ID for a text or string field in a collection.
The ID takes the form of `{adjective}-{color}-{animal}`, such as **`spicy-blue-eagle`**.

This extension is inspired by the IDs generated by [coolaj86/human-readable-ids](https://git.coolaj86.com/coolaj86/human-readable-ids.js).


## Use Case

The idea is that this provides a realtively large set of random combinations that can be used as easily-remembered codes or IDs.

## Installation

This repository contains a [custom Directus interface](https://docs.directus.io/extensions/interfaces/) that must be built and 
then installed into your Directus instance.

### Install

Install the node dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Build

Build the extension (using rollup via directus-extension):

```
npm run build
```

### Deploy

The `dist/index.js` file must be moved to the directus `/extensions/interfaces` directory.  First, set the DIRECTUS_EXTENSIONS_PATH environment 
variable to the path of the Directus extensions directory (either directly or by setting it in a .env file in the repository root directory). 
Then, use the included deploy script to copy the appropriate files:

```
DIRECTUS_EXTENSIONS_PATH=/directus/extensions npm run deploy
```

## Usage

To use the interface, create a standard text or string field and select "Human Readable ID" as the interface for the field.

**1. Create a new Standard Field in a Collection**
